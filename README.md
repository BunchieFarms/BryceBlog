This is just a cute little project I started, kindof as a sandbox for stuff I want to try later.


## Why Angular?
It's what we use at work and what I'm most familiar with right now.
Like I said though, this is a way for me to test things, such as JS backends. My only previous experience in backend work was with Rails, .NET, and LAMP.  

## I want to add to the list of random phrases at the top of the page.
Make a PR with additions to the 'phrases.js' file, located at `src/assets/js/phrases.ts`.
I was going to make this so that visitors could just add anything they wanted with no regulation, but that's a bad idea.
I don't want the first thing people see on my site to be the N-word.
